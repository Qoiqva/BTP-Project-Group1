# BTP405 Winter 2025: Activity 3 - Due March 21 (5\%)

## Learning Objectives

- identify a potential product and feature set based on customer need
- apply agile methodologies to management of a software product
- create a high level architecture for a given product

## Overview

This activity will form the basis of your _project 2_. Your task is to develop an e-commerce product for a domain of your choice. Conduct some domain analysis and user research see how your product will fit into the current environment. The agile product engineering approach must be used to manage your development.

At this point, no code or implementation details are expected. The expectation is that you will be able to run sprints which produce an "shippable product increment" _after_ this activity is complete.

## Deliverables

- a product vision
- personas, user stories, features
- a high architecture diagram
- artifacts showing research that was done
- your JIRA (or similar project management tool) project, this should contain your product backlog. Your initial sprint should involve creating these documents.

Your team must contain 3-4 members

## Grading Criteria

Your work will be evaluated based on how well you have applied the concepts explored in the course material.
